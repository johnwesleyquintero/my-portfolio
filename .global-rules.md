### Optimization Plan for 100% Performance Score

**Objective**: Optimize a website to achieve a 100% performance score across key metrics using Astro, React, JSX/TSX, and Bun.

**Key Metrics**:
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Page speed
- Mobile-friendliness
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance)
- SEO best practices
- Image optimization
- Code minification and compression
- Caching implementation
- Efficient use of CDNs

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Core Web Vitals**:
   - Optimize LCP with SSR and efficient image formats.
   - Minimize FID by reducing JavaScript execution time.
   - Prevent CLS with reserved space for dynamic content.

2. **Page Speed**:
   - Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Enable Gzip/Brotli compression.
   - Implement lazy loading for images.

3. **Mobile-Friendliness**:
   - Ensure responsive design with CSS media queries.
   - Test on various mobile devices.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles.
   - Ensure keyboard accessibility.

5. **SEO Best Practices**:
   - Implement structured data with JSON-LD.
   - Optimize meta descriptions and keywords.

6. **Image Optimization**:
   - Compress images and use responsive formats.
   - Implement lazy loading.

7. **Code Minification and Compression**:
   - Use tools like Terser and CSSNano.
   - Enable server-side compression.

8. **Caching**:
   - Implement browser and server-side caching.
   - Use service workers for offline caching.

9. **CDN Usage**:
   - Serve static assets via a CDN.
   - Optimize global content delivery.

**Reporting**:
- Measure baseline performance using tools like Google Lighthouse.
- Document specific optimizations and their impact.
- Compare before and after scores for each metric.

***Implement without breaking functionalities.***
